Intro
-----
Spaceballz(BALLS) is a free open source project derived from Bitcoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Bitcoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
After completing windows setup then run Spaceballz-qt.
Alternatively you can run windows command line (cmd) in Spaceballz program dir.
  cd daemon
  Spaceballzd
You would need to create a configuration file Spaceballz.conf in the default
wallet directory. Grant access to Spaceballzd/Spaceballz-qt in anti-virus and firewall
applications if necessary.

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  Spaceballz works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the Spaceballz network.


Upgrade
-------
All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade from 0.4, first backup wallet in qt menu or by command line
Spaceballzd backupwallet <destination_backup_file>
Then shutdown Spaceballzd by
Spaceballzd stop
Uninstall v0.4 client, download and install v0.5 client.
If upgrade is performed after or close to upgrade deadline, blockchain
re-download is required.

Intro
-----
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
